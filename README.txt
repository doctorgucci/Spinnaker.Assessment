Instructions.

1. I have added a bacpac file - on sqlserver import it as data-tier application. (right-click databases in SSMS - Import Data-Tier application - select bacpac file)

2. I did not have the oppurtunity to make everything configurable - urls for example. (Please make sure the API url is correct depending on your local settings - use IISExpress)
